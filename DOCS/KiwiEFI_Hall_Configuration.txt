KiwiEfi HALL TRIGGER CONDITIONER CONFIGURATION
Please refer to the schematic pdf
(Default) is as jumpered when purchased from KiwiEFI


INPUT GROUNDS
CNK-   JP1 when CLOSED grounds the Crank- (negative) input (Default)
CAM-   JP8 when CLOSED grounds the Cam- (negative) input  (Default)



INPUT FILTERS
CNK Filter   JP2 CLOSED = Level 1 filtering
                  JP3 CLOSED = Level 2 filtering
                  Both CLOSED = Level 3 filtering  (Default)


CAN Filter   JP9 CLOSED = Level 1 filtering
                 JP10 CLOSED = Level 2 filtering
                 Both CLOSED = Level 3 filtering  (Default)

The default setting is Level 3 (maximum filtering) which should be suitable for a sensor up to about 24 teeth
Level 2 should be suitable for a sensor of 24 - 48 teeth
Level 1 should be suitable for a sensor of 48 - 60+ teeth 

NOTE: - any filtering on the Speeduino board should be removed
          - pullups on the Speeduino board can be enabled or not, they have no effect



OUTPUT POLARITY 
CNK Polarity  JP4 1-2 = output signal is the same polarity as input  (Default)
                    JP4 2-3 = input to output signal is inverted 

CAM Polarity  JP6 1-2 = output signal is the same polarity as input  (Default)
                     JP6 2-3 = input to output signal is inverted 




LED POLARITY  
CNK LED Polarity JP5 1-2 = LED is turned on when input is negative  (Default)
                          JP5 2-3 = LED is turned on when input is positive

CAM LED Polarity JP7 1-2 = LED is turned on when input is negative  (Default)
                          JP7 2-3 = LED is turned on when input is positive
 



OPTIONAL RESISTORS R2 and R5 - the pullup resistors are 1K by default, by adding parralel resistors (R2 and R5) the pullup current can be increased if required.
